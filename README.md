# Visualization of the Fourier Series:
Every Periodic Function can be supposed to consist of sine / cosine waves of different amplitude and phase shifts.
So a periodic waveform can be represented as sum of infinite number of sine and cosine waves.
Here I plot a rectangular pulse (in blue) and its expression for Fourier representation (in orange).

# Visualization:
By including more terms in the Fourier series expansion, we can achieve a closer approximation of the original waveform. As the number of terms increases, the approximation becomes more accurate and captures the finer details of the waveform.
